    <h2>Three Reasons I admire the character</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>He is humorous, polite, mature, and gentlemanly. He is always caring to people around him.</li>
        <li class="highlighted">He is always been a guardian. "We are guardians, but also a bunch of miserable 
            wretches that are constantly fighting against threats and madness. " 
            He is brave to carry up the duty of saving the world against Outer Gods even though 
            what he want at the beginning is only going back to home or living a peaceful life. </li>
        <li>He is cute!! He is so pretty, handsome, and strong. </li>
    </ul>
